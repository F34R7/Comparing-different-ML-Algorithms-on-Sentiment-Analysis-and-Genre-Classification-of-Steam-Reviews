This code is for my bachelor thesis for WU Vienna. It contains a variety of machine learning algorithms with the aim of comparing and analyzing them.

The textual data comes from Steam. The API was used to scrape for several 100k reviews to train MLs on them for both sentiment and genre classifcation tasks. 

The Steam API Call notebook contains the code in order to obtain the reviews. 

The Steam Cleaner notebook cotains every cleaning step that was introduced. It is also responsible for removing the genre and game name tags from the reviews for the third ML training notebook.

The other 3 notebooks include the actual ML. It contains accurarcy scores as well as confusion matrices in order to make the evaluation easy and intuitive.

Feel free to experiment with the notebooks!
